## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)

income <- read.csv("data/avg_daily_income.csv")
women <- read.csv("data/mean_years_in_school_women_25_34_years.csv")

income_longer <- income |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = `X1800`:`X2100`, 
               names_to = "Year", 
               values_to = "Income")

women_longer <- women |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = `X1970`:`X2015`, 
               names_to = "Year", 
               values_to = "Number of Years in School")
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
